# 2.2 srpi-config Configuration Tool User Guide

:::info Note
The `srpi-config` configuration tool is only applicable to the `RDK X3` and `RDK X3 Module` development boards and is not suitable for the `RDK Ultra` development board.
:::

## Introduction

`srpi-config` is a system configuration tool. To open the configuration tool, type the following command in the command line:

```
sudo srpi-config
```

> `sudo` is a command for privilege management. It is necessary to enter it here in order to have root privileges for configuration management. The default sunrise account does not have permission to modify system files.

If you are using a desktop system, you can find the `RDK Configuration` application in the menu for configuration. It will also open a configuration terminal similar to the image above.
